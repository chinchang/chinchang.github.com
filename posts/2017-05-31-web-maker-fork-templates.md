title: "Web Maker: Forking and Fonts"
---

I recently released v2.7.0 of [Web Maker](https://webmakerapp.com) with 2 super useful features - Forking & Customizable fonts. Here is a bit about them.

## Forking

Forking basically allows you to create a duplicate of any of your existing creation. This sounds like a small feature, but its usefulness is enormous. Forking any creation gives you the power to define templates. Say, your creations are mostly based on `three.js` and a `three.js` work requires a bit of same starter code always. With Forking now in Web maker, you do this:

 - Create a new creation.
 - Add `three.js` from *Add Library* option.
 - Add the required base code for creating a new `three.js` work.
 - Change your creation's title to: _Template: three.js starter_

 Thats it. Now you have created a readymade template for starting any `three.js` work in future. How do you use it? Simply:

 - Click on the _Open_ button.
 - Type in `template` to search across all saved templates (remember you named your template so).
 - Hit the __Fork__ button on the the desired template. And done!

And all this user experience is completely accessible through just keyboard too!

## Fonts!

Customizable fonts are something that developers always dig. And with the new generation fonts with ligatures, it has become more exciting to use them. With this new release, you now get 4 awesome fonts with ligatures (except Inconsolata) - Fira Code (now default), FixedSys, Monoid and Inconsolata. Big thanks to the developers of these fonts! If you want to see some other font as well, let me know in comments or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/webmakerapp).

I personally like the game-y feel of the _FixedSys_ font. Now coding feels like playing a game :)
