Ever wanted to connect your PCs to form a LAN and play your favourite multiplayer game ?If you got stuck creating a LAN, then this tutorial will guide you through. So all you have to do is just follow the steps and you'll be on a LAN in no time.

The tutorial is in 2 parts : **[WIRED](http://kushagragour.in/blog/2011/05/creating-a-lan-wired-lan-using-crossover-cable/)** and **WIRELESS**.
This one will show how to create a wired LAN using just a crossover cable.

So lets get going !

**Requirements for this tutorial :**
 * 2 Computer machines having lan card.
 * 1 [Crossover cable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cable).


(**NOTE** : The visuals shown here are of Win 7, though it would work just fine on any Windows.)

**STEP 1 :**
Connect the 2 machines with the crossover cable.

**STEP 2 :**
On first machine, Open the control Panel and go over to **View network status and tasks**.

**STEP 3 :**
Now click on **Change adapter settings** in the left panel.

**STEP 4 :**

Select the **Local Area Connection** adapter, right-click on it and select **Properties**.

**STEP 5 :**

Now we need to edit some IPv4 properties of the connection. Click on **Properties** with **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** selected in the list.

**STEP 6 :**

Change the IP addresses to those shown in the picture below and click **OK**.

**STEP 7 :**

Follow the same steps on the second machine and change its IP addresses as shown in the picture.

This is it ! Your both machines are now connected in a LAN.

You can also set some additional sharing options. For that:

**STEP 8 :**
Click on **Change advanced sharing options** in the **Network and Sharing Center**.

Here you can find several sharing options which you can set according to your preferences.

One disadvantage of using a crossover cable to form a LAN is that only 2 machines can be connected together. If you want to go over 2, you will need a switch.

In next tutorial, I shall demonstrate how to form a wireless ad-hoc network using wi-fi which enables more than 2 machines to be connected.

**Stay tuned :)**
