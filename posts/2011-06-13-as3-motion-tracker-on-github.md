Hiya everyone !

I have been working on motion tracking since my [last blog post](http://kushagragour.in/blog/2011/06/a-supercool-night-with-motion-tracking/) on experiment with Justin Windle's motion tracker. Inspired by all the fascinating stuff, I started writing my own motion tracker in Actionscript 3.0 which is finally done and up on [Github](https://github.com).

Though it tracks motion nicely it still needs to be improved to track smoothly and more accurately. I'll be also working on integrating gesture recognition with it.

Download it. Play with it. Improve it.

Cheers !
