Hey everyone


# **HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL!**


It has been an awesome year in 2011, with many things happening as expected and many unexpectedly. But overall...superb.

The first news of 2012 from my side is that I have put one of my alpha games on github. Its basically a clone of the very famous copter game by seethru. You can fork the game **[HERE](https://github.com/chinchang/Copter)**.

So fork it, hack it and enjoy.
May this new year bring more n more joy to all.

Cheers!
